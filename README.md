# GuidedDiffusion

Recently, it has been shown in the literature that using CLIP as a classifier to guide the generative models like GAN and StyleGAN can lead to interesting results. Here, I implemented [DiffusionClip](https://github.com/gwang-kim/DiffusionCLIP)) as a classifier guided diffusion model.









This is the DDPM code that I have used here https://github.com/explainingai-code/DDPM-Pytorch/tree/main


The pretrained weights for the id_loss is grabbed from https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1b7d9xyvUm1y2xxMyX_LTy9UgamVf563F&export=download
